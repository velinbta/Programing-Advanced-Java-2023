6. Find Evens or Odds
You are given a lower and an upper bound for a range of integer numbers. Then a command specifies if you need to list all even or odd numbers in the given range. Use predicates that need to be passed to a method.

Examples:

Input 1:
1 10
odd

Output 1:
1 3 5 7 9

Input 2:
20 30
even

Output 2:
20 22 24 26 28 30
