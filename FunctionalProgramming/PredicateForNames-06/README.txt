6. Predicate for Names
Write a predicate. Its goal is to check a name for its length and to return true if the length of the name is less or equal to the passed integer. You will be given an integer that represents the length you have to use. On the second line, you will be given a string array with some names. Print the names, passing the condition in the predicate. 

Examples:

Input 1:
4
Sara Sam George Mark John

Output 1:
Sara
Sam
Mark
John

Input 2:
4
George Peter Zara Sara

Output 2:
Zara
Sara
