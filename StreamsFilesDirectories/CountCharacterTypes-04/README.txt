4. Count Character Types
Write a program that reads a list of words from the file ("input.txt" from the Resources - Exercises(task directory)) and finds the count of vowels, other symbols, and punctuation marks. Assume that:
a, e, i, o, u are vowels, only lower case.
All others are other symbols.
Punctuation marks are (! , . ?).
Do not count whitespace.
Write the results to another file - "output.txt".

Examples:

Input:
On January 1 , 1533 , Michael Angelo, then fifty-seven years old, writes
from Florence to Tommaso de' Cavalieri, a youth of noble Roman family,

Output:
Vowels: 41
Other symbols: 72
Punctuation: 6
