4. Basic Queue Operations
You will be given an integer N representing the number of elements to enqueue (add), an integer S representing the number of elements to dequeue (remove/poll) from the queue, and finally, an integer X, an element that you should check whether is present in the queue. If it is - prints true on the console, if it is not - print the smallest element currently present in the queue.

Examples:
