DoublyLinkedList:

The DoublyLinkedList will have similar functionalities as the Java LinkedList. Just like the structures from the previous workshop, LinkedList will work only with integers.
It will have the following functionalities: 

void addFirst(int element) - adds an element at the beginning of the collection
void addLast(int element) - adds an element at the end of the collection
int get(int index) - Returns the element at the specified position in this list
int removeFirst() - removes the element at the beginning of the collection
int removeLast() - removes the element at the end of the collection
void forEach() - goes through the collection and executes a given action
int[] toArray() - returns the collection as an array
