CustomStack:

The custom stack will have similar functionality to the Java ArrayDeque
It will have the following functionality:

void push(int element) - Adds the given element to the stack
int pop() - Removes the last added element
int peek() - Returns the last element in the stack without removing it
void forEach(Consumer<Integer> consumer) - Goes through each of the elements in the stack
