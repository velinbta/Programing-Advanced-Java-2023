1. Generic Box
Create a generic class Box that can store any type. Override the toString() method to print the type and the value of the stored data in the format "{class full name}: {value}".

Use the class that you've created and test it with the class java.lang.String. On the first line, you will get n - the number of strings to read from the console. On the next n lines, you will get the actual strings. For each of them, create a box and call its toString() method to print its data on the console.

Examples:

Input 1:
2
life in a box
box in a life

Output 1:
java.lang.String: life in a box
java.lang.String: box in a life

Input 2:
1
I am a programmer

Output 2:
java.lang.String: I am a programmer
