4. Sum Matrix Elements
Write a program that reads a matrix from the console and prints:
The count of rows
The count of columns
The sum of all matrix's elements
On the first line, you will get the matrix dimensions in the format "{rows, columns}". On the next lines, you will get the elements for each row separated by a comma.
